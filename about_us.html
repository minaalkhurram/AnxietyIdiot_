             during childhood can influence the development of social anxiety problems.

    <h1>The root cause of social anxiety</h1>
    <p>
        The root cause of all social anxiety attacks is fear. When we
        
        fear being judged by others, when we fear judgment for ourselves,
         when we don't fit into societal norms, or when we believe that it will be worse if we are 
        judged — these are all triggers for our fears of embarrassment

    <h1>Reason behind suddenly developing social anxiety </h1>

         embarrassing experience, or slowly over time. There is some evidence that social 
         anxiety runs in families,
         so there may be other members who share similar difficulties as your child.
